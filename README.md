# Tower-Defense-Game-in-Unity
3D Tower defense game made in Unity with C# for Capstone class

Too many asset files to add all models/prefabs.  Group members have added a lot of excess and I havent had a chance to pare it down.  Also added windows exe file to play game in windows, but the game was designed for html5 hosting.  Windows version hasnt been tested.  Will host more when I get a chance. 

The majority of my work was the scripts.  All inspired by and much taken from the Brackeys youtube tutorial series found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beuoNuK2tbk.
